def check_queue():
    """
    Specifically checks for the status of the Jenkins queue. The docs are
    sparse here, but
    ``jenkins/core/src/main/resources/hudson/model/queue/CauseOfBlockage`` has
    the specific reasons this check needs:

    * *BecauseLabelIsBusy* Waiting for next available executor on {0}

    * *BecauseLabelIsOffline* All nodes of label \u2018{0}\u2019 are offline

    * *BecauseNodeIsBusy* Waiting for next available executor on {0}

    * *BecauseNodeLabelIsOffline* There are no nodes with the label \u2018{0}\u2019

    * *BecauseNodeIsOffline* {0} is offline

    The distinction is the need for a label or a node. In the case of a node,
    it will get matched directly to the nodes in the configuration, in case of a label
    it will go through the configured nodes and pick the first matched to its labels.

    Label needed example
    --------------------
    Jenkins queue reports that 'All nodes of label x86_64 are offline'. The
    configuration has::

        nodes: {
            'centos6': {
                ...
                'labels': ['x86_64', 'centos', 'centos6']
            }
        }

    Since 'x86_64' exists in the 'centos6' configured node, it will be sent off
    to create that one.

    Node needed example
    -------------------
    Jenkins reports that 'wheezy is offline'. The configuration has a few
    labels configured::

        nodes: {
            'wheezy': {
                ...
            }
            'centos6': {
                ...
            }
        }

    Since the key 'wheezy' matches the node required by the build system to
    continue it goes off to create it.
